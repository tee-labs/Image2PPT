"""Erase text regions from a slide image, preserving icons/logos.

Reads OCR JSON (from ocr_paddle.py) and writes a "cleaned" image where
ordinary text regions are replaced with their local background color
via solid fill (not blur).

Three OCR results are PRESERVED (not erased) — they're likely part of
icons/logos:
  1. Likely-icon misclassifications (low confidence single chars,
     high-edge-density 1-2 char detections, square colored bg).
  2. Text inside small square colored regions (text labels INSIDE
     icons, e.g. "数据" + binary code in a highlighted card).
  3. Text inside logo strips (>=4 short texts in same y-band, in
     bottom 15 % of the slide).

Background fill uses SIDE-AGREEMENT voting: each side
(top/bot/left/right) gets ONE vote (not pixel-weighted). Avoids the
bug where a wide white area above a colored banner outweighs the
banner color from the other 3 sides.

File layout (search the section banners):
  - CLI: parse_args
  - OCR pre-processing: preserve / logo / trim helpers, preprocess_ocr
  - Icon-vs-text heuristics: is_likely_icon and stroke-component filter
  - Background colour fill: _strip_bg_median, fill_color
  - Erasure (main work): erase_text
  - Icon-review packet I/O: _load_icon_decisions, _dump_icon_review_packet, …
  - Driver: main

Usage:

    """Replace text STROKE pixels (not the whole bbox) with the local bg
    colour.

    OCR bboxes are tight on the glyphs but often clip a pixel or two of
    adjacent content — a flat bbox fill paints over icon edges, banner
    borders, or stroke fringes that sit just inside the OCR rectangle.
    Stroke-only fill keeps those bystanders intact:

    1. Sample the bg color from the 4-side ring (existing fill_color
       logic, with side-agreement voting + tight-container fallback).
    2. Inside the bbox, find pixels noticeably different from bg
       (max-channel diff > 30) — these are stroke + antialiased
       neighbourhood + any non-bg content the bbox accidentally covers.
    3. From those candidates take the MEDIAN colour = the dominant
       stroke colour. Pixels close to that median (per-channel diff
       <=40) are the text strokes; everything else (a contrasting icon
       pixel that happened to fall inside the OCR rectangle) is kept.
    4. When OCR emitted per-word/per-character boxes, constrain the mask
       to those geometry boxes so same-colour borders or connector lines
       in the broader OCR line bbox survive.
    5. Dilate the stroke mask by 1 px to cover antialiased fringe that
       sits just below the colour threshold, then paint only those
       pixels with bg.

    `overrides` lets the LLM icon-review stage replace specific
    heuristic decisions. Shape:

         "components": {(x1,y1,x2,y2): "icon"|"text", ...}}

    `icon` = preserve as visual (no erase); `text` = erase. Bboxes are
    in absolute image coordinates and must match the values emitted by
    `--icon-review-dump`. Returns (cleaned_img, mask, decisions) where
    `decisions` is the list of icon-vs-text calls made on this pass —
    used to build the LLM review packet.
